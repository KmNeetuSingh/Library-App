# 📚 **My Library**

**Reimagining Personal Reading with MERN Stack Innovation**

Built on the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)**, it enables users to **track progress, rate and review books, and curate personal reading lists**—all within a modern, responsive, and intuitive interface.
